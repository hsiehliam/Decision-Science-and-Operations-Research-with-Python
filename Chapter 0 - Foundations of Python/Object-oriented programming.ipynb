Therefore, I assume you're all have some experience in OOP with the other languages, and this brief note is written to show how to create a class in Python. Some examples of the three key principles, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, are also provided. "

    "In short, object is a collection of variables and functions and class is just like a template of object; so, we can create many objects from a class. That is why an object is also called an instance of a class. The basic definition for a class is:\n",

    "All classes have a built-in function called \\_\\_init\\_\\_(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated. Therefore, we ususally define this function to assisgn values for properties and execute those necessary operations when objects are being created. Functions for a class can be mutiple."
